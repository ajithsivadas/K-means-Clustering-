# K-means-Clustering-
Clustering is a Machine Learning technique for grouping of set of unlabeled data points into a specific group/ cluster. It is basically a type of unsupervised learning method. Generally, it is used as a process to find meaningful structure, explanatory underlying processes, generative features, and groupings inherent in a set of examples. The data points are in one cluster should have similar properties and features while data points of different cluster must have dissimilar features. It is a collection of objects on the basis of similarity and dissimilarity between them.
